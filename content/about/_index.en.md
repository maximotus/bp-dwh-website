Since 1999 I support various customers in different industries to implement BI systems based on Oracle technology.

In the beginning as an employee of Oracle, a little later as a freelancer.

The spectrum goes from the initial definition, what do I want, to the modeling, the integration by means of ETL/ELT, the technical implementation, the documentation up to the instruction of the customer in the provided platform for analyses.

As a coach I additionally support at any time for all questions around the project.
